    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li> 650ml coffee </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 
            40g cocoa powder (for sponge finger soak)
        </li>
        <li> 
            500ml double cream
        </li>
        <li> 
            450g mascapone cheese
        </li>
        <li> 
            6 egg yolks
        </li>
        <li> 
            150g sugar
        </li>
        <li> 
            50ml Bailey’s Irish Cream
        </li>
        <li> 
            300-400g sponge fingers (depends on the size of the tray)
        </li>
        <li> 
            50g cocoa powder (for topping)
        </li>
    </ol>
<h3> 
    Method
</h3>
    <ol> 
<li> 
    Make a pot of coffee in the normal way that you usually do and pour it out on a tray to allow it to cool quickly. Whisk in the vanilla extract and cocoa powder.
</li>
<li> 
    Add the heavy cream to a bowl, and whisk on high for 1 minute or until stiff peaks are formed. Pop it in the fridge whilst you prepare the mascarpone and egg mixture next.
</li>
<li> 
    Add mascarpone to a bowl and stir to loosen it up.    
</li>
<li> 
    In a double boiler bowl, add the egg yolks, sugar, salt and the Baileys. Place over a pot of simmering water and whisk constantly. Continue whisking for about 5-10 mins or until the temperature of the egg mix reaches approx 170F/77C. One at temp, the mixture should be slightly thickened and have lightened in colour.
</li>
<li> 
    Whisk the egg mixture into the mascarpone until smooth. Fold in half of the whipped cream prepared earlier. When mostly incorporated, fold in the rest. 
</li> 
<li> 
    To build the tiramisu layers, dip each sponge finger into the coffee mixture for 2-3 seconds and place it into the baking dish. Depending on the size of your dish, you should be able to fit in 24 in total. Layer in half of the mascarpone cream mixture, spreading evenly. Repeat, layering the dipped sponge fingers followed by a second layer of the cream mix.
</li>
<li> 
    To finish, top with cocoa powder, and pop into the fridge overnight.
</li>
    </ol>

    <body> 
        Optionally serve whilst pouring over heavy cream, or indulge in a Baileys extra thick double cream.
